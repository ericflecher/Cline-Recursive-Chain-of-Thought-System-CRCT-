# Validation and Testing Instructions

## Objective
Add validation checks and tests for the CLI Onboarding Agent's functionality to ensure reliability and correctness.

## Context
To ensure the CLI Onboarding Agent works correctly and reliably, comprehensive validation and testing are needed. This component is responsible for implementing validation checks during execution and creating tests to verify the tool's functionality.

## Dependencies
- 1A (src)
- Task 1: CLI Tool Setup
- Task 2: Template Folder Management
- Task 3: Folder Structure Generation
- Task 4: Template Document Population

## Steps
1. Implement runtime validation:
   - Add validation checks throughout the execution flow
   - Implement pre-condition and post-condition checks for key operations
   - Add comprehensive error handling and reporting

2. Create unit tests:
   - Develop unit tests for each module and key function
   - Implement test fixtures and mocks for dependencies
   - Ensure good test coverage for edge cases and error conditions

3. Implement integration tests:
   - Create tests that verify the end-to-end functionality
   - Test with various template structures and target scenarios
   - Verify correct handling of guide documents and conflicts

4. Add validation for the dogfooding exercise:
   - Implement specific tests for the Gherkin Feature Agent component
   - Create validation checks for the generated structure
   - Document the validation process and results

5. Set up continuous integration (optional):
   - Configure automated testing
   - Implement code quality checks
   - Add coverage reporting

## Expected Output
- Comprehensive validation checks throughout the codebase
- Unit tests for all modules and key functions
- Integration tests for end-to-end functionality
- Documentation of test coverage and validation results

## Notes
- Use a testing framework like pytest for efficient test development
- Consider property-based testing for complex scenarios
- Implement test isolation to prevent tests from interfering with each other
- Add logging and detailed error messages to make debugging easier
- Consider implementing a test mode for the CLI tool to facilitate testing

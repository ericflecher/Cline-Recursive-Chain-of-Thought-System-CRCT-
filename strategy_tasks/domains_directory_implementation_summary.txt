# Domains Directory Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. Modified the CLI interface to ensure all generated projects are created in a domains directory:
   - Added a new `--domains-dir` option to specify a custom domains directory (default: "domains")
   - Updated the path handling logic to ensure all projects are created within the domains directory
   - Added automatic creation of the domains directory if it doesn't exist

2. Added comprehensive tests for the domains directory functionality:
   - Test for domains directory creation
   - Test for default domains directory behavior
   - Test for handling absolute paths within domains directory

## Implementation Details

The implementation ensures that:
- All projects are created within a domains directory by default
- Users can specify a custom domains directory with the `--domains-dir` option
- Even when users provide absolute paths, projects are still created within the domains directory
- The domains directory is automatically created if it doesn't exist

## Next Steps

1. Complete the test suite by implementing remaining tests for all modules:
   - Finish implementing tests for template_reader, generator, populator, and validator modules
   - Add integration tests for end-to-end functionality
   - Implement test coverage reporting

2. Create comprehensive documentation:
   - Update README.md with domains directory information
   - Add usage examples and tutorials
   - Ensure all functions have proper docstrings

3. Implement a "dogfooding" exercise:
   - Use the CLI tool to generate a real project structure
   - Document the process and results
   - Identify and fix any issues encountered

4. Begin exploring OpenAI Agents SDK integration:
   - Implement AI-assisted template customization
   - Add intelligent conflict resolution
   - Explore other AI capabilities that could enhance the tool

5. Package and distribution:
   - Prepare the package for PyPI distribution
   - Create installation documentation
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Current Status

The CLI Onboarding Agent is now fully functional with all core features implemented, including the domains directory requirement. The modular architecture makes it easy to extend with new features and AI capabilities in the future.

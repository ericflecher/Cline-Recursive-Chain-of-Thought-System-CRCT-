# CLI Onboarding Agent - Main Strategy Instructions

## Objective
Develop a command-line interface (CLI) tool that leverages the OpenAI Agents SDK to generate a standardized folder structure for new domain projects, pre-populated with template documents.

## Context
This project aims to streamline and standardize the setup of new domain projects by automating the creation of a predefined folder structure and populating it with essential template documents. The tool will save time, reduce errors, and provide consistency across projects.

## Dependencies
- 1A (src)

## High-Level Tasks
1. **CLI Tool Setup**: Create the basic CLI structure with argument parsing for folder paths
2. **Template Folder Management**: Implement functionality to read from a template folder
3. **Folder Structure Generation**: Create logic to generate the folder structure based on the template
4. **Template Document Population**: Implement copying of template documents to the target structure
5. **Validation and Testing**: Add validation checks and tests for the tool's functionality

## Expected Output
- A functional CLI tool that can generate standardized folder structures with template documents
- Documentation on how to use the tool
- Tests to validate the tool's functionality

## Notes
- The tool should exclude any guide documents (identified by "_guide" in their names) when copying templates
- The project will be used in a dogfooding exercise to generate the initial folder structure for the Gherkin Feature Agent component

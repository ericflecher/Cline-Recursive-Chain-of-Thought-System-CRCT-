# Product Context:

## Why This Project Exists:

This project exists to streamline and standardize the setup of new domain projects by automating the creation of a predefined folder structure and populating it with essential template documents. It aims to save time and reduce errors in the initial project setup phase, providing a consistent starting point for development teams.

## Problems It Solves:

- **Manual Setup Overhead:** Eliminates the need for manually creating folders and documents, which is time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies.
- **Inconsistency Across Projects:** Ensures that all new domain projects start with the same structure and templates, promoting uniformity and ease of navigation.
- **Lack of Guidance:** Provides a structured starting point with template documents, reducing the ambiguity in how to begin documenting requirements, designs, and other project artifacts.

## How It Should Work:

- **CLI Invocation:** Users run the CLI tool with a specified folder path where the new project structure should be created.
- **Folder Structure Generation:** The tool reads from a predefined Template Folder and replicates its structure in the specified target folder, excluding any guide documents.
- **Template Document Population:** Copies template documents from the Template Folder to the corresponding directories in the target folder, ensuring they are ready for use.
- **Validation and Feedback:** The tool provides feedback on successful execution and can be validated through checks on the generated structure and documents.

## User Experience Goals:

- **Simplicity:** The tool should be easy to use with a straightforward CLI command.
- **Reliability:** It should consistently generate the correct folder structure and documents without errors.
- **Efficiency:** The process should be quick, allowing users to set up new projects rapidly.
- **Clarity:** The generated structure and documents should be clear and intuitive, aiding users in understanding where to place different types of project artifacts.

## Value Proposition / Key Benefits:

- **Time Savings:** Significantly reduces the time required to set up a new project by automating repetitive tasks.
- **Standardization:** Ensures all projects adhere to a consistent structure, facilitating easier collaboration and maintenance.
- **Error Reduction:** Minimizes human errors in the setup process, leading to fewer issues down the line.
- **Scalability:** Easily scales to support the creation of multiple projects with the same standardized setup.
